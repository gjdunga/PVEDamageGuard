# Changelog

All notable changes to PVEDamageGuard are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-15

Initial public release.

### Added
- Type-based NPC classifier with public `NpcCategory` taxonomy (RealPlayer, HumanNpc, AnimalNpc, VehicleNpc, OwnedTrap, Building, Deployable, Environment, Other).
- Universal NPC detection via `BasePlayer.IsNpc`, `BaseNpc`, `NPCPlayer`, `BaseHelicopter`, `BradleyAPC` (no prefab-name string matching).
- Projectile and explosive attribution via `creatorEntity` and `OwnerID.IsSteamId()` chain walks (correctly identifies heli rockets, Bradley shells, scientist grenades, C4, satchels, trap-owner reflect).
- Per-attacker, per-damage-type scaling for NPC -> Player hits (Bullet, Slash, Stab, Bite, Blunt, Explosion, Arrow, plus a Default fallback).
- Uniform NPC -> Structure scaling (configurable, 0 = invulnerable, default 0.5x).
- PvP reflect with `HashSet<ulong>` re-entrancy guard, configurable multiplier, optional same-team carve-out, optional block-instead-of-reflect mode.
- Public API hooks callable by other plugins: `API_Classify(BaseEntity)`, `API_IsNpcAttacker(HitInfo)`, `API_ReflectDamage(BasePlayer, BasePlayer, HitInfo, float)`, `API_GetNpcScaling(string)`.
- TruePVE companion mode: auto-detects TruePVE at load (via `[PluginReference]`); when present and `YieldToTruePVE=true`, yields PvP allow/block decisions to TruePVE and only applies scaling on top.
- Companion warnings for PVEMode and NextGenPVE when both are loaded alongside.
- `/pdg test` command: raycasts from the admin's crosshair, classifies the target entity, and reports which rule would fire (the killer diagnostic feature).
- Five-tier logging: None / Reflects / Scaled / All / Trace, runtime-switchable via `/pdg log <level>`.
- Optional structured file logging to `oxide/logs/PVEDamageGuard/damage-YYYY-MM-DD.txt`.
- Permission split: `pvedamageguard.bypass` (damage immunity for testing) and `pvedamageguard.admin` (chat command authorization), independently grantable.
- Lang files for English, Russian, Spanish, and Latin per uMod convention.
- `/pdg scale <DamageType> <multiplier>` for live tuning of the NPC -> Player scaling table without editing JSON.

### Notes
- This is a new plugin, not a fork of any existing damage plugin. It is named "PVE Damage Guard" rather than "Damage Control" to avoid confusion with the existing umod.org plugin by MSpeedie/Wulf.
- Tested against Rust forced-wipe builds through 2026-05.
